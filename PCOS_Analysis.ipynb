    "Polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS, is one of the most common causes of female infertility, afffecting as many as 5 million US women who are of childbearing age. Women who have PCOS produce more male hormones than normal which may impact their overall heath, even past their childbearing years. Symptoms can be different for every woman, which makes it very difficult to diagnose. This analysis explores various PCOS symptoms or variables that increase the likelihood of a PCOS diagnosis or infertility.\n"

This will allow exploratory analysis regarding patients that are classfied with infertility versus without infertility. THis can be found in the 'Additional EDA' Section at the end of this notebook. \n",
